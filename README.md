The backend part consists of two repos:
* [Infrastructure](https://github.com/s4nt14go/serverless-stack-ext-resources): Deploys S3, DynamoDB & Cognito, it doesn't change a lot and can be shared between several Serverless API stages. It uses [AWS CDK](https://aws.amazon.com/cdk) with [SST](https://github.com/serverless-stack/serverless-stack) for deployment.
* [API](https://github.com/s4nt14go/serverless-stack-ext-api): Deploys API Gateway and Lambdas, most of the development iterations are done on this repo. It uses [Serverless Framework](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) for deployment.
